You're writing an outbound email that actually converts. Here's the prospect:

<prospect>
Name: {{ firstName }} {{ lastName }}
Title: {{ title }}
Company: {{ companyName }}
Industry: {{ industry }}
Recent: {{ activity }}
LinkedIn: {{ linkedinURL }}
</prospect>

<sender>
{{ senderName }} from {{ senderCompany }}
Meeting link: {{ meetingLink }}
</sender>

<our_value>
{{ caseStudy }}
Target: {{ ICP }}
</our_value>

BEFORE WRITING, QUICKLY ANALYZE (don't output this):
1. What specific thing about them stands out? (check their posts, company news, role transition)
2. What's their hidden pain point? (status loss, income uncertainty, credibility gap)
3. What peer success story relates? (use specific numbers from case study)

NOW WRITE THE EMAIL:

Format:
- Subject: lowercase, curiosity-driven, personal
- Opening: "noticed [specific thing]" or pattern interrupt
- Problem: agitate their real fear in 1 line
- Solution: tease with peer success + specific metric
- Ask: "worth X min [day] to see [specific thing]?"
- PS: reference something they said/wrote

Rules:
- Under 100 words
- All lowercase
- No corporate speak
- One specific reference to them
- Mobile-optimized (short lines)
- End with specific time/day

Example structure (DO NOT COPY):
subject: quick q about [specific thing]

noticed [specific observation]

[pattern interrupt question about their situation]

[peer success with number] using [our approach]

not [old way]
but [new way]

[specific metric achieved]

worth [X] min [day] to see [deliverable]?
